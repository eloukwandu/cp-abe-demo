# cp-abe-demo
A short demo on implementing CP-ABE.
I used Charm-Crypto 0.50 library from https://github.com/JHUISI/charm on Ubuntu 19.04, Python 3.7.3
The coding is an example of [BSW07] John Bethencourt, Amit Sahai, and Brent Waters. “Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption.” In Security and Privacy, 2007. SP’07. IEEE Symposium on, pp. 321-334. IEEE, 2007.
Using library from 4 above required some modifications as contained in ABE Master. The reason is that the original library is not compatible with ython 3.x
